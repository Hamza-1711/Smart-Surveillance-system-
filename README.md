# Smart-Surveillance-system-
The aim of this project is to design a web application to detect fire and smoke using the modern machine learning techniques like CNNs and RNNs. 

## 📁 Project Structure

- **Data pre-processing and Model training** – Code notebooks/scripts for training models  
- **Dataset** – Dataset used for training (not included in repo)  
- **Models** – Saved trained models (RNN `.h5` and YOLO `.pt` formats)  
- **Plots** – Visualizations of model training and evaluation  
- **Web-app** – Streamlit-based UI for real-time fire/smoke detection  
- **LICENSE** – Project license (MIT)


## 📦 Installation
- git clone https://github.com/Hamza-1711/d-fire-detection.git
- cd d-fire-detection

# Create virtual environment
- python -m venv venv
- venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies
- pip install -r Web-app/requirements.txt

# ▶️ Run the App
- cd Web-app
- streamlit run app.py
- Make sure you have:
- RNN_model.h5 in Models
- CNN_model.pt in Models
